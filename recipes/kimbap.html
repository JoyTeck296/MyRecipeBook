  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    I received this great recipe from a Korean friend of mine. This Korean sushi is different and very good!
    Kimbap is frequently compared to Japanese sushi, but the only true similarities between these two dishes are their seaweed wrappers and the inclusion of rice. Unlike sushi, kimbap does not involve raw fish or other raw seafood. Instead, the filling consists of eggs, meat, and vegetables.

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 cup uncooked glutinous white rice (sushi rice)</li>
    <li>1 ½ cups water</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon sesame oil</li>
    <li>Salt to taste</li>
    <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
    <li>4 sheets sushi nori (dry seaweed)</li>
    <li>1 cucumber, cut into thin strips</li>
    <li>1 carrot, cut into thin strips</li>
    <li>4 slices American processed cheese, cut into thin strips</li>
    <li>4 slices cooked ham, cut into thin strips</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons sesame oil</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Rinse rice in a strainer or colander until water runs clear. Combine rice with 1½ cups water in a saucepan. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low; cover and simmer until rice is tender, 12–14 minutes. Spread cooked rice onto a baking sheet to cool. Season with 1 tablespoon sesame oil and salt.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> While rice is simmering, pour beaten eggs into a skillet over medium-high heat and allow to cook without stirring or turning to get a flat layer of cooked egg. When egg is completely cooked, remove from the skillet and set aside on a cutting board to cool.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Separate nori sheets onto a flat surface and divide cooled rice between them, leaving only a ½-inch strip seaweed visible at the top of each sheet. Arrange strips of egg, cucumber, carrot, cheese, and ham in thin layers over rice.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Beginning with the bottom of each sheet of nori, use a bamboo sushi mat to firmly roll each piece into a cylindrical shape. Brush each roll with ½ teaspoon sesame oil and cut into 6 equal pieces.</li>
  </ol>
